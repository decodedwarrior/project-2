# To-Do List App

This is a simple **To-Do List** application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks are stored in **localStorage**, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- Add tasks to the to-do list
- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them
- Remove tasks by clicking the "×" button next to each task
- Tasks persist using **localStorage**, so they are retained even after page refresh
